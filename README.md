# VOXR - Meditative Singing Design Spec

## Overview
VOXR is designed to motivate people to sing in a meditative way, yielding therarpuetic benefits, such as a relaxed and euphoric state by slowing respiration, resonating the body and stimulating the vagus nerve.

## Core Interaction

Two inputs control the character movement.

1. Audio of the user's voice  
    a. Sensor: device microphone  
    b. Controls: amplitude and frequency
    c. Mappings:  
    1. Amplitude drives elevation on the y axis with an envelope follower, feature a fairly rapid attack and very slow logarithmic release </i>
    2. Frequency modulates the y axis elevation within the "pitch fly zone", with a more responsive envelope.
2. Tilt of the headset 
    a. Sensor: gyroscope  
    b. Controls: azimuth plane  
    c. Mappings: forward, backward, left, right moves character slowly in that direction, 360 degrees on the azimuth plane </i>

## Narrative Overview
1. Vocal Calibration / Onboarding - guide and measure player's voice.
2. 3rd POV MR - more familiarization and practice, big transition
3. 1st POV MR - fly with your voice to follow the guided melody

## Scene 1: 3rd Person [MR] Vocal Calibration / Onboarding

Tutorial guides people to sing in their lowest and highest comfortable pitches.  We measure and capture to adjust gameplay accordingly.

## Scene 2: 3rd Person [MR] Player Interaction



### A voice guided "golden snitch"

Objectives
- Gently introduce the interaction and world
- Start with comfortable, achievable notes
- Build suspense in the transition

The experience guides players through an exercise to continue familarization with voice control and head tilt, by guiding a "golden snitch"-like object through space to collide with objects in a musical way.

The voice and head tilt controls the currentPitch sphere as the main player.  In this 3rd person POV, we guide a player object freely through the world, within the MR room's bounds on the X and Z axis.  The height is limited in Y axis by the Height Calculation parameters driven by the amplitude and pitch of the voice.  X and Z axis and driven by head tilt.

### Pickup Visualization
TBD

### Height Calculation

```
Height = baseHeight + (log(frequency) - log(minFreq)) / (log(maxFreq) - log(minFreq)) * (maxHeight - baseHeight)

Where:
- baseHeight = 0.5 meter (height at 80 Hz)
- maxHeight = 2.5 meters (height at maximum frequency)
- minFreq = 80 Hz (lowest supported note)
- maxFreq = 300 Hz (highest supported note)
```

## Scene 3: 1st Person [VR] Player Interaction

Objectives
- Apex and payoff
- Give sensation of flying
- Stimulate and motivate singing

### Voice-Height Mapping

Players control their height through voice pitch:
1. Voice frequency is analyzed in real-time using the McLeod Pitch Method
2. Detected frequency is mapped to a target height using logarithmic scaling
3. Player's vertical position smoothly transitions to match their voice pitch
4. Visual feedback shows current and target heights
5. Confidence metrics ensure stable pitch detection

### Musical Pickup Collection

Musical pickups are placed at heights corresponding to their frequencies:
1. Each pickup represents a note in the sequence
2. Pickups are positioned ahead of the player in a path
3. Players must match the pickup's pitch to reach its height
4. Visual and audio feedback indicate proximity to correct pitch
5. Successful collection requires maintaining pitch for a brief duration

### Height Calculation

```
Height = baseHeight + (log(frequency) - log(minFreq)) / (log(maxFreq) - log(minFreq)) * (maxHeight - baseHeight)

Where:
- baseHeight = 4 meters (height at 100 Hz)
- maxHeight = 20 meters (height at maximum frequency)
- minFreq = 80 Hz (lowest supported note)
- maxFreq = 300 Hz (highest supported note)
```

## Visual Feedback

### Pickup Visualization
- Pickup color indicates sequence position
- Opacity changes based on current/target status
- Size pulses subtly to draw attention
- Forward path shows upcoming sequence
- Height lines show pitch targets

### Player Feedback
- Current pitch shown as floating sphere
- Color gradient indicates pitch accuracy
- Particle effects for successful matches
- Distance markers show height targets
- Frequency and confidence displays
